        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        My name is Avery Neal and I am 14 years old. I have a family of three and two gerbils. I go to Licking Heights High School, and I am a freshman. The picture below of me and my family was taken on the Disney Dream Cruise ship, which was one of my favorite vacations. I am very short. I am 5 foot 1 inches, so pretty much everyone I talk to looks down on me. I played soccer for ten years, but I am starting to look into playing volleyball. The new high school is going to be built next year, so the picture of the school down below is going to turn into the middle school I'm pretty sure.
